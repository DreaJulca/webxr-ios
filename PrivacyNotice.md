# WebXR Viewer Privacy Notice
 
### _Effective February 5, 2018_
 
At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet. We strive to collect only what we need to improve the WebXR Viewer application for everyone. In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data the WebXR Viewer collects and shares, and we point you to settings to share even less. 

We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla [Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from the WebXR Viewer.

## Things you should know

Mozilla’s WebXR Viewer is an augmented reality (AR) tool that lets you create and run AR experiences.  When you use the Viewer, we collect certain information so that we can improve our product. 

- *Information We Collect Automatically When You Use WebXR Viewer*: The WebXR Viewer starts sending Mozilla data once you install the application and start using it on your device. This includes:
   - _Interaction data_: The WebXR Viewer sends data to us about your interactions with the application. This includes information such as when you launch the WebXR Viewer, when you background or foreground the Viewer, and when you load a webpage that activates the AR capabilities of the Viewer.  We don’t track any of the webpages you access through the Viewer.
   - _Technical data_: The WebXR Viewer sends data to us about your WebXR Viewer version, device operating system, and basic information about crashes and errors. When the WebXR Viewer sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

   Read the telemetry documentation for [iOS](Telemetry.md).

- *Turning-off Data Collection*: Data collection can be disabled by you at anytime, which will stop corresponding data collection by the WebXR Viewer. This can be done by going to the Settings page in the WebXR Viewer application, which directs you to the iOS Settings panel. 

- *Non-Mozilla Services*: We use the following services of other companies: 

  - Apple ARKit - We use Apple ARKit, which integrates the iOS device camera and motion features to produce augmented reality experiences in the WebXR Viewer.  Apple may collect information about your location as part of its AR Kit functionality. To learn more about Apple’s data collection practices related to this integration, we encourage you to review their [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/). 

This privacy notice is for the most recent version of the WebXR Viewer distributed by Mozilla. This application is under active development and may contain different privacy characteristics than subsequent versions of the application. This notice will be updated from time to time to reflect the privacy characteristics of subsequent versions.
